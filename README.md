The following is a retrospective on what went wrong during the course of the game jam Cancer Bear was meant to be a submission to, and the lessons I learned by not being able to complete the original goal.
## Scope
The foremost problem was the scope of the game. It was just too big for me to complete in 14 days. By itself it would have been the largest game I had ever made. Rather than subject the world to whatever small amount of good gameplay I could polish out of a turd in the next 2 days, I think it would be better for my mental health(as well as that of the moderators of the jam), if I resigned and made no submission at all. 
## Lack of Real Working Early Prototypes & Incorrect Focus
Early in making the game I decided to begin making the art(about on the second day). This was a horrible idea for a variety of reasons: 
1) I could have spent that time whilst I had high motivation making, testing, and refining the systems of the game, instead it was spent draining my motivation by making art(an activity which I have now realized I despise).
2) It resulted in extremely high quality early sketches that I then realized I couldnâ€™t live up to later in the jam.
3) I set the game in stone when I created that art, which made changing it rather difficult.
## The Ermine (IDK what they wanna be called lol)
I do wanna that "The Ermine" because they were the only person that enabled me to get as far as I did. <3
